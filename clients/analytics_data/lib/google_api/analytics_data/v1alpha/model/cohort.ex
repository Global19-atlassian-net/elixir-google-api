defmodule GoogleApi.AnalyticsData.V1alpha.Model.Cohort do
  @moduledoc """
  Defines a cohort. A cohort is a group of users who share a common characteristic. For example, all users with the same acquisition date belong to the same cohort.

  ## Attributes

  *   `dateRange` (*type:* `GoogleApi.AnalyticsData.V1alpha.Model.DateRange.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The cohort selects users whose first visit date is between start date and end date defined in the `dateRange`. In a cohort request, this `dateRange` is required and the `dateRanges` in the `RunReportRequest` or `RunPivotReportRequest` must be unspecified. The date range should be aligned with the cohort's granularity. If CohortsRange uses daily granularity, the date range can be aligned to any day. If CohortsRange uses weekly granularity, the date range should be aligned to the week boundary, starting at Sunday and ending Saturday. If CohortsRange uses monthly granularity, the date range should be aligned to the month, starting at the first and ending on the last day of the month.
  *   `dimension` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - The dimension used by cohort. Only supports `firstTouchDate` for retention report.
  *   `name` (*type:* `String.t`, *default:* `nil`) - Assigns a name to this cohort. The dimension `cohort` is valued to this name in a report response. If set, cannot begin with `cohort_` or `RESERVED_`. If not set, cohorts are named by their zero based index `cohort_0`, `cohort_1`, etc.
